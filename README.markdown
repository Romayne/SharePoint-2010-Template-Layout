SharePoint 2010 Template Layout
====================

This .NET MVC3 Razor template is offered as a way to create professional web based, administrative applications that resemble the SharePoint 2010 layout, with a few minor tweaks and additions, to add to the overall user experience.

How To Use
====================

Integrate the given layout files, CSS, and javascript files into your MVC3 project structure. The project contains two sample Controllers (Home and User) that show how the specific view layouts can be integrated into your own MVC3 administrative applications.

Known Issues
====================

This template is a stripped down version of what I have been using for some time, therefore the CSS and images directory might contain content that is not actually being referenced by this layout.

Copyright and Ownership
====================
The SharePoint name and any images used are copyright to their original authors.
